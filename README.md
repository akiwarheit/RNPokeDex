# RNPokeDex

A PokeDex app built using React Native & Typescript.

The purpose of this small exercise is to setup a project using commonly used libraries. At some point this will become a framework (?).

The tech stack:

1. Redux
2. Redux Saga
3. React Navigation
4. Axios
5. Reactotron
6. Re-reduced (Read more: https://github.com/alanrsoares/re-reduced)
7. React Native Config
8. Storybook

# Folder Structure

Folder structure follows several design patterns / guidelines.

```
src
  |-Components (atomic design)
  |-Domain (Ducks)
  |-Views (no fuss views)
```

# API

We are using https://pokeapi.co/ to retrieve all the Pokemon data needed

# Design (Storybook)

_WIP_
